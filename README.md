# WT Smart Contracts

Smart contracts of the Winding Tree platform.

The smart contracts in the [airline folder](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts/tree/master/contracts/airline) are designed to upload inventory and interact with it in the WT platform.

## Requirements

LTS Node 10.3.0 is required for running the tests.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts
npm install
```

## Deploy

keys.json example:
```
{
  "mnemonic": SEED_PHRASE,
  "infura_apikey": API_KEY
}
```

```sh
npm run deploy-NETWORK
```

## Test

* To run all tests: `npm test`

* To run a specific test: `npm test -- test/WTAirline.js`

* To generate coverage report: `npm run coverage`

## Flattener

A flattener script is available by running `npm run flattener`, this will create flattened version of the contracts without imports in one single file for all contracts in the contracts folder. This is needed if you plan to use tools like [etherscan verifier](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract) or [securify.ch](https://securify.ch/).
